excerpt: >-
  Vector vortex beams (VVBs) have garnered significant attention for their potential to
  revolutionize applications such as high-resolution imaging and quantum communication.
  The development of an easy-to-use and effective method for representing the spatially
  inhomogeneous polarization distribution of VVBs is imperative. In this paper, we propose
  what we believe to be a novel compact detector for quickly and accurately measuring the
  polarization distribution of arbitrary VVBs by means of polarization holography. When a
  VVB illuminates the detector, multiple diffracting beams appear simultaneously that can be
  used to get the VVBâ€™s polarization distribution. Incidentally, it can also measure the state
  of polarization of a scalar beam, which can be considered a special case of spatially inhomogeneous
  polarization. Experimental results confirm the detector's measurement accuracy, positioning it
  as a promising tool for advanced optical applications.
