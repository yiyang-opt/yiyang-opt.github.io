Polarization holography has emerged as a promising method for manipulating the amplitude, phase, and polarization states of light waves. This study proposes what we believe to be a novel design method for various all-optical logic devices, including a complete set of all-optical Boolean logic gates and a polarization-controlled 1 × 4 optical switch, utilizing polarization holography. Through the angle multiplexing technique, specially designed polarization holograms are recorded in polarization-sensitive material, transforming it into all-optical Boolean logic gates and a polarization-controlled 1 × 4 optical switch. The all-optical logic devices developed in this work function as passive diffractive optical elements, enabled by a single piece of polarization-sensitive material, eliminating the need for additional circuit control. This approach offers the advantages of a simple structure, low cost, and instantaneous response. We contend that this advancement will facilitate the expansion of the application domains of polarization holography, particularly enhancing the capabilities of all-optical information processing.
