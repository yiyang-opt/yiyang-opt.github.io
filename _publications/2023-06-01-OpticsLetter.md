We propose a simple and inexpensive method for the fabrication of polarization splitters with designable separation angles and a controllable active area, based on polarization holography of tensor theory. First, we design two polarization holograms that reconstruct waves with only p- or s-polarization components, respectively. Then, after we recorded these two holograms on the same position of the recording material using the interference approach, as a result, a polarization splitter could readily be prepared. The separation angles of fabricated polarization splitters can be easily adjusted by changing the interference angle, and the active area can also be easily modified by changing the sizes of the interference beams and recording material during the recording process. The experimental results verify the reliability and accuracy of this method. We believe that this work may broaden the application field of polarization holography.
