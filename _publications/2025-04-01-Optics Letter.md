excerpt: 'Polarization holography offers a distinctive advantage by enabling simultaneous control over light waves’ amplitude, polarization, and phase. Within the tensor polarization holography theory framework, coefficients A and B, representing the scalar and tensor components of photoinduced changes in the dielectric tensor, respectively, play a pivotal role in manipulating the reconstruction wave. Accurate measurement and control of A/B are essential for achieving specific functionalities. In this Letter, we present a straightforward and effective method for measuring coefficients A and B, enabling independent observation of their variations while determining A/B. Unlike previous methods, this approach eliminates the influence of the interference angle, simplifies the experimental process, and accommodates the arbitrary polarization state of the recorded hologram. It provides a powerful means of precisely controlling A/B through exposure adjustment, facilitating the fabrication of advanced optical devices for diverse applications.'
