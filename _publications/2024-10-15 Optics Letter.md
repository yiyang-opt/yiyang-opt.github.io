We propose a polarization superposition orthogonal theory based on tensor polarization holography. Based on this theory, the holographic multiplexing capability can be improved measurably. The orthogonality of polarization waves is characterized by the null reconstruction in polarization holography, achieved through the superposition of multiple basic polarization reference waves. This paper analyzes the orthogonality of linear polarization wave superposition and circular polarization wave superposition using the tensor polarization holography theory. Using the polarized holography multiplexing technique, we experimentally verify the orthogonality of polarization wave superposition. Our experimental results align with the theoretical analysis, indicating potential applications in polarization encoding and decoding by this theory, thereby diversifying optical encryption technology Additionally, we demonstrate that polarization superposition orthogonality holds significant promise for optical control technology.
