Based on polarization holography, circular polarization beam splitters with separation angles of up to 100Â° have been fabricated. The left- and right-handed circularly polarized waves can be reconstructed by the two holograms that were designed by the tensor theory of polarization holography, respectively. In the fabrication of circular polarization beam splitters, two holograms were recorded only by the interference method in the same area of the polarization-sensitive material. This method is simple, inexpensive, and easy to adjust the separation angles and element size. The diffraction efficiency and the polarization state of the reconstructed waves were tested under different incident waves, and the experimental results are in good agreement with the theory. This work not only deepens our understanding of polarization holography but also expands the applications of polarization holography.
