This talk introduces a polarization holography-based technique for measuring the inhomogeneous polarization distribution in vector vortex beams. The method allows high-resolution polarization mapping across the beam profile. Authors: Yi Yang, Peiliang Qi, Jinyu Wang, Xinyi Yuan, Xianmiao Xu, Tian Ye, Shenghui Ke, Shujun Zheng, Zhiyun Huang, and Xiaodi Tan.
