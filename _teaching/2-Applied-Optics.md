*Applied Optics* provides an in-depth study of the behavior of light, optical system design, and image formation through a blend of theory and practical analysis.

## Introduction

*Applied Optics* is designed to build a solid foundation in both geometric and physical optics. The course emphasizes the fundamental principles governing the behavior of light—including refraction, reflection, and diffraction—while also covering the methods and tools used in designing optical systems. Students will explore how light interacts with various media and the impact of these interactions on image formation in a variety of instruments.

## Course Content

This course covers the following key parts:

- **Fundamental Principles of Optics:**  
  An introduction to the basic concepts, including the speed of light in different media, refractive index, the reversibility of light paths, and the vector form of the laws of reflection and refraction.

- **Core Imaging Concepts:**  
  Detailed exploration of imaging theories in symmetric optical systems made from spherical surfaces, including ray tracing formulas, principal planes, focal points, and the optical invariant. The course covers essential calculation methods for image positions and sizes, as well as determining the effective focal lengths in complex systems.

- **Optical Instrumentation:**  
  An overview of the design and functionality of optical instruments that meet human visual requirements. Topics include the working principles of magnifiers, microscopes, and the optical considerations of the human eye, such as depth of focus and stereoscopic effects.

- **Mirror and Prism Systems:**  
  Discussion of the applications of mirrors and prisms in optical instruments, including methods of image orientation determination and the combination of coaxial systems with reflective and refractive components.

- **Selection of Imaging Rays in Optical Systems:**  
  Instruction on how to select and manage imaging rays in various optical configurations such as telescopes and microscopes, covering aspects like field lenses, depth of field, and cold stop efficiency in infrared systems.

- **Basics of Radiometry and Photometry:**  
  Introduction to the measurement of light, including solid angles, relative sensitivity of the eye, illuminance, and luminance—focusing on both theoretical and practical aspects.

- **Image Quality and Advanced Systems:**  
  Analysis of image quality factors, encompassing aberrations, resolution, contrast, and a discussion on advanced optical systems including telescopes, microscopes, cameras, and projectors.
